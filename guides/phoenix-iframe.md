# Include in a web blog or article

Phoenix can be included inline in an article or blog using `<iframe>`.

Check [available URL options](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/blob/master/guides/users.md#url-options) for applying possible options through the URL.

For example, if Phoenix is deployed at `http://test-website.com/phoenix`. We can include it as an HTML snippet like below:

```html
<iframe src="http://test-website.com/phoenix?hideWidgets=true"></iframe>
```
